# Analyzing Qualitative Data

> Lazar Chapter 11.

Goal of analysis of data: `unstructured data -> detailed description`.

## Content Analysis

:::theorem Content Analysis
refers to the process of developing a representative description of text or other unstructured input.
:::

Types of content:
+ media content: content that is published.
+ magazine, personal website, youtube, tiktok ...
+ audience content: content you ask for.
+ surveys, questionnaires...

## Text Analysis
::: theorem coding
Assigning categories and descriptors to blocks of text.
Basically sorting parts of the text content into a set of commonly occurring categories.
:::

### Coding schemes:
+ Emergent coding
    + without a theory or model to guide analysis.
+ A priori coding
    + using a theory or model to guide analysis.

#### Grounded theory and emergent coding
Use this if you don't have categories to sort your text before starting.

Consists of four stages:
+ Open coding
    + Analyze the text and identify any interesting phenomena in the data 
    + Need to find terms to describe the interesting instances that emerge from the data 
    + In vivo code: coding categories derived from a participants vivid explanation 
+ Development of concepts
    + Collections of codes that describe similar contents are grouped together to form higher level ‘concepts’, which can then be grouped to form ‘categories’ 
    + Axial coding: the identification and definition of relationships between concepts 
+ Grouping concepts into categories
+ Formation of a theory
    + Aim at creating inferential and predictive statements about the phenomena recorded in the date
    + We develop explicit causal connections or correlations between the concepts and categories identified in the previous stages 
        + Might be followed by selective coding, in which previously coded data might be revisited from the context of the emerging theory

#### A priori Coding and theoretical frameworks

#### Building a code structure

after the key coding items are identified they can be organized into a a code list (or "nomenclature").

:::theorem nomenclature
A nomenclature is a list of numbered categories intended to represent the full array of possible responses to a specific question. For studies using theoretical
:::

### Coding the text

### Ensuring High-Quality Analysis

**percentage of agreement among coders.**
$$\%Agreement = \frac{\text{the number of cases coded the same way by multiple coders}}{\text{the total number of cases}}$$


**Kappa**
$$K = \frac{P_a - P_c}{1-P_c}$$

#### Subjective versus Objective coders

:::theorem Subjective Coders
When the coders are the same people that developed the coding scheme and also study and collect the data.
:::

:::theorem Objective Coders
When the coders are not involved with other aspects of the research.
